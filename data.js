Because of this law, revisions to high school mathematics and economics curriculum frameworks now include personal finance concepts. The 2013 law also requires that textbook updates in social sciences, health and mathematics include personal finance concepts. California does not mandate specific textbooks to be used at high schools but does for grades Kindergarten through eighth. So, new updates of certain K-8 textbooks should include personal finance content.

See: <a href=\"https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/textedcod60119.asp\" target=\"_blank\">California Education Code Related to Text Books</a>. California's 2016 law requires the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to consider the inclusion of a robust list of personal finance topics on financial literacy in the next revision of the history-social science curriculum frameworks. Since these frameworks were last updated in 2016, a bill analysis indicated that the next update of these frameworks may not occur until 2024. The bill also requires the IQC to consider including information on financial literacy in six different grade levels during Kindergarten through Grade 12 (twice each in the following grade spans: Kindergarten through fifth, sixth through eighth and ninth through Grade 12.). Currently, the California Department of Education recommends that a ninth grade elective course in personal finance be offered, but local districts are not required to offer such a course.

Washington adopted grades Kindergarten through 12 financial education learning standards and guidelines in September 2016. Learning standards define what all students need to know and be able to do at each grade level.

Washington allows each school district to determine how it will deliver that instruction. <br /><em></em></p>",
        "Caveat" : "<p>While Washington requires all school districts to provide access to personal finance instruction, many delivery mechanisms are allowed to meet this requirement. Districts may provide instruction through \"a regularly scheduled class period, before or after school, during lunch periods, at library and study time, at home, via online learning opportunities, through career and technical education course equivalencies, or other opportunities.\" Districts must provide access to this instruction but are not required to make students participate in the instruction. Any voluntary programming that requires a high school student to come to school early or stay late, adds additional homework (like an online program), or skip lunch or study time will likely result in far fewer students taking the instruction than if it is offered as a stand-alone elective. The Center for Financial Literacy is treating the state requirement to provide access to personal finance instruction as similar to requiring a high school to offer a stand-alone personal finance elective to all students. For this reason, Washington earns a grade of C. Unlike a semester elective course, which requires 60 hours of instruction, the Washington requirement does not specify the number of instruction hours required to meet the access rule. The delivery mechanisms identified could be very short in duration and could greatly discourage attendance by being extremely inconvenient for students. There is a large risk that some high schools and school districts will meet the access requirement in a manner that is so inconvenient that only a small percentage of students will take advantage of the personal finance instruction offering. It is not clear how Washington will measure student achievement in financial literacy or how the state monitors local school district implementation of the financial literacy education requirement.<br /><em></em></p>"
